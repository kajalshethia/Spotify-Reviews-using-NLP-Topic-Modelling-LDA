## What is Topic Modeling?

Topic modeling is a machine learning technique used to automatically discover hidden topics in a large collection of text documents. It groups words that frequently occur together into "topics" and assigns each document a mix of these topics, helping us understand the main themes or subjects in the data without reading everything. 

It’s commonly used in analyzing articles, reviews, or social media content to uncover patterns or insights.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: A collection of text documents.
2. **Modeling**: An algorithm like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) identifies word patterns.
3. **Output**: A set of topics and the proportion of each topic in every document.

## Applications

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understand key themes in customer reviews.
- **News Clustering**: Group articles by topic.
- **Social Media Insights**: Identify trending discussions.
